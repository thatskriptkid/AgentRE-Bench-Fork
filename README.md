# AgentRE-Bench-Fork

This project is a **fork** of the original [AgentRE-Bench](https://github.com/agentrebench/AgentRE-Bench) repository. In addition to the upstream benchmark, this fork adds **support for evaluating models on static analysis of Windows PE (Portable Executable) binaries**, using the same task structure and scoring as the ELF benchmark (see [Windows PE (--platform pe)](#windows-pe---platform-pe) below).

---

A benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on **long-horizon reverse engineering tasks** with deterministic scoring.

> **Platform:** Linux/Unix (ELF x86-64). Windows PE supported via `--platform pe`.

AgentRE-Bench gives an LLM agent a compiled ELF binary and a set of Linux static analysis tools (strings, objdump, readelf, etc.), then measures how well it can identify C2 infrastructure, encoding schemes, anti-analysis techniques, and communication protocols — all without human guidance.

## Why This Benchmark?

### Why Synthetic?

All 13 binaries are compiled from purpose-built C sources with known ground truths. This gives us:

- **Deterministic judging** — every field has an exact expected answer, no ambiguity
- **Controlled difficulty progression** — from plaintext TCP shells (level 1) to metamorphic droppers with RC4 encryption (level 13)
- **Reproducibility** — anyone can compile identical binaries and verify scores

Real malware would require subjective expert judgment and introduce licensing, ethics, and reproducibility issues. Synthetic samples eliminate all of that while testing the same analytical capabilities.

### Why Agentic?

Traditional RE benchmarks ask a model a question and check the answer. AgentRE-Bench requires the agent to:

- **Plan** which tools to use and in what order
- **Interpret** raw tool output (hex dumps, disassembly, symbol tables)
- **Synthesize** findings across multiple tool calls into a structured analysis
- **Manage a budget** of 25 tool calls — wasting calls on redundant queries means running out before finding the answer

This tests reasoning, tool selection, and information synthesis — not just pattern matching.

### Why Long-Horizon?

Simple RE questions ("What architecture is this binary?") don't differentiate models. The hard problems require chains of 10-25 tool calls where each call's output informs the next decision. Level 13 requires the agent to:

1. Identify encrypted strings via entropy analysis
2. Locate the encryption key in the binary
3. Determine the key storage mechanism (XOR mask)
4. Decode the actual C2 URL
5. Identify 18 distinct techniques across anti-debugging, process injection, and network evasion

This is where agent capability differences become visible.

### Why Deterministic Judging?

Every agent answer is scored against a fixed ground truth with weighted fields and Jaccard overlap for set comparisons. There is no LLM-as-judge, no subjective rubric, no human grader variance. The same answer always produces the same score.

Hallucinations are penalized: claiming a technique not present in the binary costs -0.05 per false claim. This means models can't game scores by guessing everything.

## Task Difficulty Progression

| Level | Task | Techniques | Difficulty |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | TCP Reverse Shell | Plaintext C2, socket connect, dup2, execve | Trivial |
| 2 | XOR Encoded Strings | XOR encoding, string obfuscation | Easy |
| 3 | Anti-Debugging Shell | ptrace detection, timing checks | Easy |
| 4 | Polymorphic Shell | Self-modifying code, runtime decryption | Medium |
| 5 | Multistage Shell | Staged payload delivery | Medium |
| 6 | ICMP Covert Channel | ICMP protocol C2, covert channel | Medium |
| 7 | DNS Tunnel Shell | DNS-based C2 tunneling | Medium |
| 8 | Process Hollowing | Process injection, memory manipulation | Hard |
| 9 | Shared Object Injection | .so injection, dlopen/dlsym | Hard |
| 10 | AES Encrypted Shell | AES encryption, key recovery | Hard |
| 11 | Fork Bomb Shell | Process evasion, fork techniques | Hard |
| 12 | JIT Compiled Shellcode | Runtime code generation, JIT | Very Hard |
| 13 | Metamorphic Dropper | RC4 encryption, anti-analysis, metamorphic code | Bonus |

Levels 1-12 are **standard tasks** (averaged to 1.0 pt max). Level 13 is a **bonus task** with a deeper rubric (1.0 pt max). **Total possible: 2.0 points.**

## Scoring Model

### Standard Levels (1-12)

Each task is scored across 5 weighted fields:

| Field | Weight | Scoring |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `decoded_c2` | 0.40 | Exact match = 1.0, host-only match = 0.5 |
| `techniques` | 0.30 | Jaccard overlap between predicted and ground truth sets |
| `file_type` | 0.10 | Exact match (case-insensitive) |
| `encoded_strings` | 0.10 | Exact match (boolean) |
| `c2_protocol` | 0.10 | Exact match (case-insensitive) |

**Hallucination penalty**: -0.05 per technique claimed but not in ground truth.

### Bonus Level (13)

10 weighted fields including encryption algorithm, key, key storage mechanism, decoded strings, and anti-analysis techniques. Lighter hallucination penalty (-0.03) given the larger technique set.

### Aggregate Scoring

```
Main Score  = average(level_1_score, ..., level_12_score)    # 0.0 - 1.0
Bonus Score = level_13_score                                  # 0.0 - 1.0
Total Score = Main Score + Bonus Score                        # 0.0 - 2.0
```

## Benchmark Metrics

Beyond correctness, AgentRE-Bench records research-grade metrics for every task:

**Per-Task Metrics:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `score` | Final weighted score after hallucination penalty |
| `field_scores` | Per-field breakdown (decoded_c2, techniques, etc.) |
| `tool_calls_total` | Number of tool calls used |
| `tool_calls_by_type` | Distribution across tool types |
| `redundant_tool_calls` | Identical tool calls repeated (same name + args) |
| `invalid_tool_calls` | Tool calls that returned errors |
| `invalid_json_attempts` | Times the agent responded with text instead of a tool call |
| `hallucinated_techniques` | Techniques claimed but not in ground truth |
| `missing_techniques` | Ground truth techniques the agent failed to identify |
| `steps_to_answer` | Tool calls before submitting final answer |
| `max_steps_hit` | Whether the agent exhausted its 25-call budget |
| `wall_time_seconds` | End-to-end wall clock time |
| `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` | Token consumption |

**Aggregate Metrics:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `success_rate` | Fraction of tasks with a valid submitted answer |
| `avg_tool_calls_per_task` | Mean tool calls across all tasks |
| `avg_tool_calls_per_success` | Mean tool calls for tasks that got an answer |
| `avg_hallucination_rate` | Mean hallucinated technique count per task |
| `episode_length_*` | Wall time distribution (min/max/mean/median) |
| `tool_usage_distribution` | Which tools models prefer across all tasks |
| `max_steps_hit_count` | How often agents exhaust their budget |

These metrics enable **failure taxonomy** — categorizing failures into:
- Byte-level reasoning failure
- Control-flow misinterpretation
- API hallucination
- Tool misuse
- Early termination
- JSON format violation

**Zero Python dependencies** for ELF mode. All LLM provider calls use Python's built-in `urllib.request`. No SDKs required. PE mode requires `pefile` (see [requirements-pe.txt](requirements-pe.txt)).

### Tool Sandbox

All tools execute inside Docker containers with strict isolation:

```
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \
  --network=none --read-only --memory=512m --cpus=1 \
  -v binaries:/workspace:ro \
  agentre-bench-tools:latest <command>
```

- `--network=none` — no network access
- `--read-only` — immutable filesystem
- `--memory=512m` — memory cap
- Workspace mounted read-only

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `file` | File type identification |
| `strings` | Extract printable strings (configurable min length) |
| `readelf` | ELF headers, sections, symbols, program headers |
| `objdump` | Disassembly, symbol tables, section contents |
| `nm` | Symbol listing |
| `hexdump` | Hex + ASCII dump at specific offsets |
| `xxd` | Hex dump (alternative format) |
| `entropy` | Shannon entropy per sliding window (detects encrypted/compressed data) |

Plus `final_answer` — a structured submission tool the agent calls when done.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- **Linux x86-64**: gcc, binutils, file, xxd, python3 (for local builds and `--no-docker` mode)
- **macOS**: Docker (for cross-compilation and sandboxed tool execution)

### 1. Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/AgentRE-Bench.git
cd AgentRE-Bench

# Create .env with your API key(s)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add at least one provider key
```

### 2. Build Binaries

```bash
chmod +x build_binaries.sh
./build_binaries.sh
```

On **Linux x86-64**: uses local gcc directly (install with `apt install gcc` if needed — no Docker required).
On **macOS / Apple Silicon**: uses Docker with `--platform linux/amd64` to cross-compile.

### 3. Build Tools Image

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t agentre-bench-tools:latest -f Dockerfile.tools .
```

### 4. Run

```bash
# Single task with verbose output
python run_benchmark.py --task level1_TCPServer -v

# Full benchmark
python run_benchmark.py --all

# Different providers
python run_benchmark.py --all --provider anthropic --model claude-opus-4-6
python run_benchmark.py --all --provider openai --model gpt-4o
python run_benchmark.py --all --provider gemini --model gemini-2.0-flash
python run_benchmark.py --all --provider deepseek --model deepseek-chat
python run_benchmark.py --all --provider qwen --model qwen3-coder-plus

# Custom output directory
python run_benchmark.py --all --report results/opus_run1/

# Windows PE binaries (optional)
python run_benchmark.py --all --platform pe
python run_benchmark.py --platform pe --task pe_level1 -v
```

### Windows PE (--platform pe)

To test **Windows PE** binaries:

1. **Build 12 PE binaries**: run `./build_win_binaries.sh`. This compiles the same sources from `samples/` (level1_TCPServer.c … level12_JIT_Compiled_Shellcode.c) with MinGW-w64 to `binaries_pe/level1.exe` … `level12.exe`. Windows code is selected via `#ifdef _WIN32` in those files. Requires `mingw-w64` (e.g. `apt install mingw-w64`) or Docker.
2. Define tasks in `tasks_pe.json` and ground truths in `ground_truths_pe/` (included for the 12 levels).
3. Create a venv and install PE tools: `./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-pe.txt`
4. Run with `--platform pe` (uses tools: peinfo, pedisasm, pesymbols, pe_entropy, file, strings, hexdump, xxd).

With Docker, the tools image includes `pefile` and PE scripts. Without Docker, Python is run from `./venv/bin/python`.

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--all` | | Run all tasks |
| `--task ID` | | Run a single task by ID |
| `--platform` | `elf` | `elf` (Linux ELF) or `pe` (Windows PE) |
| `--provider` | `anthropic` | `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, `qwen` |
| `--model` | per-provider | Model name |
| `--api-key` | from .env | API key override |
| `--report DIR` | `results/` | Output directory |
| `--max-tool-calls` | `25` | Tool call budget per task |
| `--max-tokens` | `4096` | Max tokens per LLM response |
| `--no-docker` | | Run tools via local subprocess |
| `-v` | | Verbose: show agent reasoning + tool I/O live |

## Output

```
results/
  agent_outputs/              Raw agent JSON answers (one per task)
  transcripts/                Per-task scoring, metrics, and full message logs
  benchmark_report.json       Aggregate report with all metrics and scores
```

## Standalone Scorer

The scorer works independently of the agent harness:

```bash
# Single sample
python scorer.py -g ground_truths/level1_TCPServer.json \
                 -a agent_outputs/level1_TCPServer.json

# Batch
python scorer.py -G ground_truths/ -A agent_outputs/ -r report.json
```

## Testing

Run the scorer unit tests from the project root (no extra dependencies):

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Tests cover `score_file_type` (PE32/PE32+ equivalence), technique synonym normalization, and full standard scoring.

## Known Limitations

- **Static analysis only** — no dynamic execution, debugging, or sandboxed runtime. Tests static RE reasoning specifically.
- **Synthetic samples** — designed to test real RE skills, but production malware has additional complexity (packers, anti-VM, polymorphism at scale) not fully represented.
- **Fixed tool set** — agents can't install tools, write scripts, or use Ghidra/IDA. Standardizes evaluation but limits agent creativity.
- **Single-agent** — no multi-agent collaboration or human-in-the-loop.
- **Token cost** — a full 13-task run uses ~5-10M tokens on frontier models. Budget accordingly.
- **Linux/Unix default** — default binaries are ELF x86-64. Windows PE is supported via `--platform pe` (see above).

## Roadmap

- **Failure taxonomy** — systematic categorization of failure modes across models
- **Baseline comparisons** — published results for Claude, GPT, Gemini, and open models
- **Dynamic analysis tools** — strace, ltrace, sandboxed execution
- **More PE samples** — expand `tasks_pe.json` and ground truths for Windows
- **Multi-turn refinement** — tasks requiring iterative hypothesis refinement
- **Public leaderboard** — model comparison across providers and versions
